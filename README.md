# 2-Dimensional-K-means-clustering-model-in-python
We will clustering the given datapoints i.e the type of customers on the basis of their salary and spending limit.

Clustering is similar to classification, but the basis is different. In Clustering you donâ€™t know what you are looking for, and you are trying to identify some segments or clusters in your data. When you use clustering algorithms on your dataset, unexpected things can suddenly pop up like structures, clusters and groupings you would have never thought of otherwise.

-> we will be using elbow method model for getting the optimal number of clusters.
-> And sklearn library to import KMeans class.
-> and fitting the Kmeans object in the dataset to predict the cluster_id for the given datapoints.
-> once we have obtained the Clusters. we can use MATPLOTLIB.PYPLOT to plot the different datapoints.
